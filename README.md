# Southeast-Community-Foundation-Analysis

Welcome to my comprehensive data analysis project, which is focused on the [Southeast Community Foundations](https://secfoundation.org). The foundation provides high-dosage sessions, individualized learning plans, and the priceless offer of free tutoring services for kindergarten through eighth-grade students. These components serve as the core of the foundation's dedication to educational improvement, which aims to strengthen and raise the community of both Southgate and Huntington Park by providing focused assistance.

The interactive dashboard is an easy-to-use tool for examining math and ELA skills in grades 1 through 5. Quickly flipping between the academic years 2022 and 2023, the KPI table is displayed in the upper left corner, allowing users to dynamically change the ELA and Math Stack bar charts for a focused examination of academic skills. Thanks to this dynamic feature, Users will receive a customized and detailed performance view. 

Users can compare the ELA and math skills of three distinct student number options (67, 24, or 86 students) using the "# of Students Per Year" option to enhance the analysis further. This feature helps to understand academic skills achieved within varied student groups by offering helpful data on performance trends. The street map featured in our dashboard also makes it simple for users to select between South Gate and Huntington Park, which affects how the data is displayed in the KPI table and Stack bar charts for regional insights. Our dashboard is a clear and easy-to-use service that allows viewers to browse linked data sets, allowing informed choices and focused responses for Southeast Community Foundation to assess.
