Welcome to my comprehensive data analysis project, which is focused on the [Southeast Community Foundations](https://secfoundation.org). The foundation provides high-dosage sessions, individualized learning plans, and the priceless offer of free tutoring services for kindergarten through eighth-grade students. These components serve as the core of the foundation's dedication to educational improvement, which aims to strengthen and raise the community of both Southgate and Huntington Park by providing focused assistance.

# Data Cleaning/ Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks with Excel:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling minimal missing values.
3. Data formatting and merging 2022 and 2023 information

### 2022 vs. 2023 Trends:

1. The line chart shows that between 2022 and 2023, the general tendency will change. Particularly, in 2022 compared to 2023, the average diagnostic levels for grades 1 through 5 were higher.

### Influence of Online Tutoring in 2022:

The higher averages in 2022 can be attributed to the online tutoring program due to COVID-19 restrictions in the LAUSD. The online format increased student engagement or focus, leading to higher diagnostic levels during that period.

### Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions:

Because of COVID-19 limits in the LAUSD, the higher averages in 2022 can be linked to the shift in online tutoring programs. During that time, the online approach improved student focus and engagement, which raised diagnostic scores.

<br>

### Parental Engagement in 2023:

According to Mr. Tafoya's important information, which offers insightful background, some students missed tutoring in 2023 due to various circumstances, including sports, family obligations, or parental choices. This highlights how crucial it is to consider outside variables that affect learning beyond the classroom, like parental choices that affect students' involvement.

<br>

### Challenges and Opportunities:

The results show how difficult it may be to keep students engaged over time, particularly when switching from online to in-person tutoring. Recognizing the causes of the 2023 average decline presents chances for solutions, such as resolving schedule issues or looking into different tutoring options, to maintain or improve the performance of students.

# Tableau Dashboard

![Dashboard](https://github.com/EddyBoror/Southeast-Community-Foundation-Analysis/assets/61037075/d96211cd-bf91-4c93-ae5f-b7f8efefa455)


The interactive dashboard I created is an easy-to-use tool for examining math and ELA skills in grades 1 through 5. Quickly flipping between the academic years 2022 and 2023, the KPI table is displayed in the upper left corner, allowing users to dynamically change the ELA and Math Stack bar charts for a focused examination of academic skills. Thanks to this dynamic feature, Users will receive a customized and detailed performance view. 

Users can compare the ELA and math skills of three distinct student number options (67, 24, or 86 students) using the "# of Students Per Year" option to enhance the analysis further. This feature helps to understand academic skills achieved within varied student groups by offering helpful data on performance trends. The street map featured in our dashboard also makes it simple for users to select between South Gate and Huntington Park, which affects how the data is displayed in the KPI table and Stack bar charts for regional insights. Our dashboard is a clear and easy-to-use service that allows viewers to browse linked data sets, allowing informed choices and focused responses for Southeast Community Foundation to assess. 

# Conclusion Analysis

The stacked bar chart compares ELA and math practice, proficiency, and mastery in grades 1-5 for 2022 and 2023, indicating improvement trends. Notably, grades 4-5 show a decline in 2023. Insights from the CEO, Mr. Tafoya reveal a shift in tutoring focus and reduced participation, explaining the performance drop. Examining the chart, grades 4-5 in 2023 exhibit fewer examples, raising questions about factors influencing the decline. This underscores the importance of one-on-one tutoring, supported by analysis. The analysis reveals connections between both ELA and math skills, emphasizing the need for consistent practice. These insights inform a strategy plan for fostering fundamental math and ELA skills across all school levels.
